 * 1 July 2001: @@@ FIXME:
 *   In journalled data mode, a data buffer may be metadata against the
 *   current transaction.  But the same file is part of a shared mapping
 *   and someone does a writepage() on it.
 *
 *   We will move the buffer onto the async_data list, but *after* it has
 *   been dirtied. So there's a small window where we have dirty data on
 *   BJ_Metadata.
 *
 *   Note that this only applies to the last partial page in the file.  The
 *   bit which block_write_full_page() uses prepare/commit for.  (That's
 *   broken code anyway: it's wrong for msync()).
 *
 *   It's a rare case: affects the final partial page, for journalled data
 *   where the file is subject to bith write() and writepage() in the same
 *   transction.  To fix it we'll need a custom block_write_full_page().
 *   We'll probably need that anyway for journalling writepage() output.
 *
 * We don't honour synchronous mounts for writepage().  That would be
 * disastrous.  Any write() or metadata operation will sync the fs for
 * us.
 *
 * AKPM2: if all the page's buffers are mapped to disk and !data=journal,
 * we don't need to open a transaction here.

 *	might try to populate it.
 *

 * next3_truncate()

 *
 * As we work through the truncate and commmit bits of it to the journal there
 * is one core, guiding principle: the file's tree must always be consistent on
 * disk.  We must be able to restart the truncate after a crash.
 *
 * The file's tree may be transiently inconsistent in memory (although it
 * probably isn't), but whenever we close off and commit a journal transaction,
 * the contents of (the filesystem + the journal) must be consistent and
 * restartable.  It's pretty simple, really: bottom up, right to left (although
 * left-to-right works OK too).
 *
 * Note that at recovery time, journal replay occurs *before* the restart of
 * truncate against the orphan inode list.
 *
 * The committed inode has the new, desired i_size (which is the same as
 * i_disksize in this case).  After a crash, next3_orphan_cleanup() will see
 * that this inode's truncate did not complete and it will again call
 * next3_truncate() to have another go.  So there will be instantiated blocks
 * to the right of the truncation point in a crashed next3 filesystem.  But
 * that's fine - as long as they are linked from the inode, the post-crash
 * next3_truncate() run will find them and release them.

/*
 * What we do here is to mark the in-core inode as clean with respect to inode
 * dirtiness (it may still be data-dirty).
 * This means that the in-core inode may be reaped by prune_icache
 * without having to perform any I/O.  This is a very good thing,
 * because *any* task may call prune_icache - even ones which
 * have a transaction open against a different journal.
 *
 * Is this cheating?  Not really.  Sure, we haven't written the
 * inode out, but prune_icache isn't a user-visible syncing function.
 * Whenever the user wants stuff synced (sys_sync, sys_msync, sys_fsync)
 * we start and wait on commits.
 *
 * Is this efficient/effective?  Well, we're being nice to the system
 * by cleaning up our inodes proactively so they can be reaped
 * without I/O.  But we are potentially leaving up to five seconds'
 * worth of inodes floating about which prune_icache wants us to
 * write out.  One way to fix that would be to get prune_icache()
 * to do a write_super() to free up some memory.  It has the desired
 * effect.
